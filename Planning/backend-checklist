Orion:
  -Research deployment strategies [done]
    -Most likely Kubernates on an Amazon EKS instance
      -Need to research what this entails [done]
        -EKS instance won't be possible. Need to host on EC2. Probably won't be using Kubernetes

  -Research server backend libraries
    -Most likely using something simple like Node

  -Research content management strategies
    -Need a library that will serve different images based on user agent
    -Will attempt to use XYB JPEG if browser supports ICC profiles
      -Use JPEGLi to create XYB JPEGs
      -Use Guetzli to optimize JPEGs (compare JPEGLi results with Guetzli to determine if separate image set can be used)
    -May use pngquant to compress pngs for any needed transparent elements
      -pngs likely to not be used
  
  -Set up script to minify HTML used on page

-Deploy EC2 [done, used linode instead]
  -Use AWS academy to set up a running stance of OpenSUSE
    -Get packages for exploring the file system over SSH
    -Get suitable text editor (most likely Vim)
    -Set up firewall rules
    -Get Node.js web server up and running

  -Point static IP to group4-fall2023.com and group4fall2023.com
